\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation}
In today's global economy, project managers are widely recognized as essential for project success across various businesses. Their strong management abilities are key to enhancing project productivity and efficiency, complementing advancements in project management tools and processes. The human element, represented by project managers' behaviors, remains crucial. Project management now encompasses human dynamics, teamwork, and interpersonal communication alongside technical execution, reflecting the growing demand for project management expertise as organizations adopt project centric approaches. Educational institutions, especially universities, must adapt by offering comprehensive project management courses that proactively prepare future project managers for the evolving work environment, emphasizing a balance between technical and interpersonal skills \cite{pant2008project}. This shift is imperative to meet the changing demands of the business landscape, emphasizing the need for a paradigm change in project management education and perception.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
The primary issue with present project management is the overemphasis on technical abilities, which frequently ignores soft or people skills. Frameworks such as the PMBOK Guide, which emphasise technical skills over soft skills runs the danger of ignoring soft skills that are just as important—like team dynamics, leadership, and communication—also exhibit this mismatch. This argues for a more integrated approach to project management education, emphasising both technical and interpersonal abilities equally. The objective is to produce managers who excel in both the technical and human aspects of project management by matching academic training with industrial needs. This well-rounded approach is essential for producing project managers who can successfully lead projects in the diverse and changing professional environment of today \cite{pant2008project}. 



\subsection{Objectives}
This case study aims to identify the non-technical capabilities that are essential to project managers' success. By doing this, we seek to enhance project leadership development and training within organisations. By emphasising the significance of soft skills in achieving project success, this study offers practitioners and their teams practical insights that can be utilised to improve project managers' abilities.

\section{Background Material}
\subsection{The Scout Law as a Leadership Model}

Effective leadership styles in project management significantly impact a Project Manager's success. Project Managers must not only coordinate tasks but also inspire and guide their teams. Unfortunately, education and training for Project Managers often prioritize technical skills over leadership development. Studies on scouting reveal the importance of a balanced leadership approach. Scouting's focus on individual growth within teams aligns with the requirements for a Project Manager, including adaptability, decision-making, problem-solving, and ethical judgment \cite{kaluzny2022scouting}. Scouting's emphasis on real-world challenges and teamwork closely parallels the needs of Project Managers. Insights from scouting studies show how young individuals develop strategic thinking, communication, and ethical leadership—critical competencies for Project Managers. Combining technical expertise with leadership skills fosters a collaborative environment vital for achieving collective project goals. Education and training for Project Managers must evolve to incorporate these leadership aspects, drawing from scouting methodologies to better prepare future professionals for Project Manager success.

\subsection{Adaptability in the Face of Disruption}

    \label{fig:Beneficiaries of Interruption}
\end{figure}

Effective Project Management hinges on a Project Manager's proficiency in managing and leveraging interruptions, a skill paramount in dynamic work settings like engineering consultancy. Research in this domain, including findings from Mordu (2016), reveals that adept Project Managers don't just cope with disruptions, such as unexpected calls or meetings, but often find them beneficial; in fact, 43.2\% of such interruptions have been shown to aid in achieving goals and increasing job satisfaction \cite{mordu2016managing}. This ability to discern the urgency of interruptions and integrate them smoothly into their workflow, without compromising project objectives, is a distinguishing characteristic of successful Project Managers, particularly in environments where multitasking and flexibility are key to success.

\subsection{Interpersonal Skills and Organizational Culture in Project Management}

Effective Project Managers rely on their interpersonal skills, including empathy, teamwork, and communication, to build trust with their teams and manage various stakeholders. The organization's culture, whether it promotes collaboration or individualism, significantly influences team dynamics and employee performance \cite{nusari2018impact}.

For a Project Manager, the ability to navigate and balance interpersonal relationships within the prevailing organizational culture is vital. Creating an environment that fosters teamwork and outstanding performance is key to project success. In essence, the Project Manager's skill in harmonizing relationships within the organization's culture directly impacts project outcomes.

\section{Results Obtained}
\subsection{Conditions}


Effective Project Managers adapt their approaches, balancing ethical and practical competencies that encompass both duty and outcome-focused strategies \cite{bredillet2015good}. In complex projects, this equilibrium blends practical action and wisdom. Leadership skills like strategic vision, adaptability, and effective communication are crucial in larger organizations, while smaller projects prioritize hands-on involvement and personalized leadership styles for an intimate and responsive atmosphere \cite{sigurdhssonpatterns}. Organizational structure, whether matrix or projectized, impacts Project Manager traits, with resource negotiation, conflict management, and cross-functional team leadership being vital in such environments. The project's life cycle stage plays a role, with early stages focusing on planning and risk assessment, and later stages on quality control, team morale, and stakeholder satisfaction. Successful Project Management requires adaptability, tailoring tactics and routines to each project environment \cite{hyvari2006success}.

\subsection{Constraints}

Effective Project Managers recognize that the success of project management traits and methodologies varies based on each project's unique context \cite{muller2010leadership}. Leadership competencies, for instance, depend on factors such as project complexity, strategic importance, and contract type, suggesting that certain leadership traits may not apply universally \cite{sigurdhssonpatterns}. Adaptability is essential in project management, with the capability to modify management styles according to specific project needs \cite{markopoulos2005project}. This adaptability is especially crucial in fast-evolving business environments where external factors like market dynamics and technological advancements can significantly influence project outcomes. Awareness of organizational structure and culture is key, as they influence the efficacy of management techniques. The dynamic and diverse nature of projects requires an adaptive approach, where a manager's success often depends on their ability to adjust to evolving project contexts \cite{pollack2016project}.

\subsection{Quality}

Project manager's success is closely linked to specific traits and methods, as evidenced by the analysis of 250 significant software projects and broader practices in the field \cite{jones2004software}. Essential traits for success include robust planning, accurate cost estimation, efficient milestone tracking, strict change control, and rigorous quality control. These factors are key in managing complexities and enhancing defect removal efficiency. Conversely, lack of these traits, especially poor quality control, often leads to project overruns or cancellations. Furthermore, successful project manager also hinges on stakeholder engagement, risk management, strategic planning, and effective communication \cite{fernandes2013identifying}. These elements contribute to meeting key success metrics like budget compliance, stakeholder satisfaction, and on-time completion. They aid in navigating complex projects, ensuring alignment with objectives, maintaining stakeholder support, and preemptively addressing potential issues. These findings underscore the importance of comprehensive planning, stakeholder management, and quality control in achieving successful project outcomes.

\section{Critical Thinking}

The qualities that have been emphasized—such as leadership, flexibility, and people skills—have an intrinsic value but may not be applicable in every situation. The importance of closely evaluating these attributes' effectiveness in a range of project situations is highlighted by their focus. For instance, leadership philosophies that work well in one organisational or cultural setting might not work well in another. Moreover, even if there is evidence linking management attributes to project performance, this connection begs concerns regarding the all-encompassing success criteria. Conventional metrics typically concentrate on meeting deadlines and staying within budget, but a more comprehensive assessment should also take into account long-term effects, team happiness, and alignment with larger organisational goals. These subtle factors frequently extend beyond what case studies normally cover.

\subsection{Assessment of Methodology}

The methodology employed relies heavily on literature reviews and case studies, which may introduce potential inaccuracies or biases. It's essential to investigate whether the sources encompass a wider range of industries and project types to ensure a more comprehensive perspective, as an excessive focus on specific areas can result in a skewed viewpoint. Furthermore, while diverse fields were examined, it's worth considering whether they authentically represent the diverse array of cultural and organizational contexts that exist. This assessment plays a vital role in assessing the global applicability of these findings.

\subsection{Future Research}

The existing framework provides a solid foundation for understanding effective project management, but there are opportunities for future investigations. For instance, it would be valuable to examine how these habits adapt and apply to emerging industries. Additionally, considering the growing prevalence of remote or virtual project teams, further research could delve into how these habits manifest in such settings. Expanding the scope of research to encompass various industry sectors, including non-traditional project environments, could yield insights into the applicability of these habits across diverse contexts.
